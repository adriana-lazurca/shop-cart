# Shopping Cart

The project is a online shopping website and was created following a tutorial presented by [Web Dev Simplified](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lATafp15HWA&ab_channel=WebDevSimplified)

### Technologies:

- **ReactJS**
- **Typescript**
- **React Router** for the navigation
- **React-Bootstrap** for styling

### State management

To persist ticket state through a page refresh, I used Context and Local Storage.

### Run

_`npm start `_

### Deploy

_`npm run build `_

_`firebase deploy`_

The application is hosted on [**Firebase**](https://shopping-cart-3bb95.web.app/).
